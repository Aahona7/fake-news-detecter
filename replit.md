# AI-Powered Fake News Detection System

## Overview

This is an advanced Streamlit-based web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to detect fake news articles. The system now includes real-time internet data fetching capabilities, allowing users to analyze live news articles from major news sources. It provides a complete pipeline for training models, classifying news articles, web scraping, and analyzing performance metrics through an interactive web interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Deployment requirement: System must be accessible remotely on any device.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web framework for rapid prototyping and deployment
- **UI Components**: Multi-page application with navigation sidebar
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and performance metrics
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state for maintaining application state across page interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **Core Logic**: Modular Python architecture with separate classes for different responsibilities
- **Processing Pipeline**: Data preprocessing → Feature extraction → Model training → Prediction
- **Model Architecture**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization for text classification
- **Text Processing**: NLTK-based preprocessing with fallback mechanisms

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove URLs, emails, HTML tags, special characters
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization with unigrams and bigrams
- **Stemming**: Porter Stemmer for word normalization
- **Stop Words Removal**: English stop words filtering with fallback list

## Key Components

### 1. Application Entry Point (`app.py`)

- Stemming and stop word removal functionality

### 3. Fake News Classifier (`fake_news_classifier.py`)
- High-level interface for the classification system
- Wraps the model trainer and provides simple predict/train methods
- Manages training state and metrics

### 4. Model Trainer (`model_trainer.py`)
- Core machine learning pipeline implementation

- Sample data generation for demonstration
- Helper functions for data manipulation

## Data Flow

1. **Data Input**: Users input news articles via Streamlit interface
2. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned using regex patterns and NLTK tools
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorizer converts text to numerical features
4. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression trains on processed features
5. **Prediction**: Trained model classifies new articles as fake or real
6. **Visualization**: Results displayed through Plotly charts and metrics

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and metrics

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit-compatible Python environment
- **Dependencies**: Requirements managed through standard Python imports
- **State Management**: Session-based model persistence

### Production Considerations
- **Remote Access**: Configured for deployment on any device via web browser
- **Scalability**: Multi-user capable Streamlit application design
- **Model Persistence**: In-memory model storage with session state
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling throughout pipeline
- **Web Deployment**: Ready for Replit Deployments with proper server configuration

### Architecture Decisions

#### Text Processing Approach
- **Problem**: Need reliable text preprocessing without external API dependencies
- **Solution**: NLTK with comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- **Rationale**: Ensures application works even when external downloads fail

#### Model Selection
- **Problem**: Balance between accuracy and simplicity for web deployment
- **Solution**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features
- **Pros**: Fast training, interpretable, good baseline performance
- **Cons**: May not capture complex patterns like deep learning models

#### Web Framework Choice
- **Problem**: Need rapid development with built-in ML visualization
- **Solution**: Streamlit with Plotly integration
- **Rationale**: Minimal code for ML web apps, excellent visualization support

#### State Management
- **Problem**: Maintain trained models across user interactions
- **Solution**: Streamlit session state
- **Limitation**: Single-user sessions, not suitable for multi-user production
